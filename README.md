# PWAOnline-OfflineBudgetTracker

With this Budget Tracker app, you can keep track of your savings and expendatures with helpful visual graphs and numbers. 

When you have an influx of cash, enter the description, dollar amount, and click Add Funds.

When you have an expense, again, enter the description, dollar amount, and click Subract Funds. 

If you are to add or subtract a fund when toggled to offline when in your inspect tools under the Network tab, the expense will go through and remain in your app once brought back online, so it is useful in either environment!

Invest wisely!
